## MEETING NOTES
Project initiated to create comprehensive portfolio showcase of modern data stack expertise. Selected monolithic repository approach with abstract technical naming to focus on architectural patterns. Will demonstrate advanced dbt macros, multi-target Power BI architectures, comprehensive notebook workflows, and complete DevOps integration. All components will be anonymized but maintain technical sophistication and realistic complexity.

**Phase 1 Infrastructure Completed**: Successfully created complete project directory structure with all major components (dbt-analytics, powerbi-models, notebooks, infrastructure, documentation, sample-data, tools). Implemented comprehensive Docker Compose environment with 10+ services including PostgreSQL, dbt-docs, Jupyter Lab, Grafana, Prometheus, MinIO, Redis, Airflow, MLflow, Superset, and Great Expectations. Created advanced Dockerfiles for dbt, Jupyter, and MLflow with production-ready configurations. Initialized Poetry project with 50+ dependencies covering data processing, machine learning, visualization, testing, and development tools. Created compelling README showcasing technical sophistication with Mermaid architecture diagrams and comprehensive feature documentation. Foundation established for implementing advanced patterns across all components.

**Schema Development Progress**: Successfully created comprehensive enterprise-grade data quality framework with 200+ individual tests across 7-layer processing pipeline (direct → source → cleaned → staging → normalized → denormalized → analytics). Implemented multi-layered validation ensuring data integrity at each processing stage with business logic validation for analytical accuracy, cross-connector consistency for unified reporting, automated monitoring of data freshness and quality, and comprehensive documentation across the entire Modern Data Stack. Added advanced fact_data_validation_w_query pattern for better validation that handles filtering and aggregation differences. Split analytics and harmonized schema files into respective subdirectories for better organization. Schema files now optimized with focused testing at appropriate layers and consistent naming conventions throughout the project.

**Mock Data Creation Completed**: Successfully created 8 CSV files in dbt-analytics/data/mock/ directory with 10 rows each for all direct layer raw source tables. Files include realistic retail and grocery data with proper account_id, connector_id, and ingestion_timestamp fields to support the complete 7-layer dbt pipeline. Created retail_connector tables (store_master_raw, product_master_raw, store_sales_raw, store_inventory_raw) with comprehensive store and product hierarchies, and grocery_connector tables (location_master_raw, item_master_raw, location_sales_raw, location_inventory_raw) with organic/health-focused product categories. Mock data provides sufficient volume and realistic relationships to test schema validations, fact_data_validation_w_query patterns, and demonstrate the full data pipeline from direct through analytics layers.

**Phase 1 & 2 Completion**: Successfully completed all Phase 1 infrastructure setup and Phase 2 DBT analytics development. Added comprehensive CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions including code quality checks, DBT testing, security scanning, container image building, and multi-environment deployment patterns. Implemented enterprise-grade pre-commit hooks covering Python code quality, SQL linting, DBT model validation, security scanning, and documentation checks. Created advanced incremental loading strategies for all fact tables with enterprise-grade macro library including late-arriving data handling, configurable lookback periods, and multiple incremental strategies (merge, delete+insert) based on table types. The project now has complete infrastructure automation and production-ready data pipeline patterns.
