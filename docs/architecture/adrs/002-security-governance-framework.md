# ADR-002: Security Governance Framework with Policy as Code

## Status
**Accepted** - December 2024

## Context

The Modern Data Stack Showcase requires a comprehensive security governance framework that can enforce security policies, ensure compliance, and provide automated security controls across our multi-cloud Kubernetes infrastructure. We needed to select a security approach that could:

1. **Enforce Pod Security Standards** and container security policies
2. **Implement Network Security** with fine-grained traffic control
3. **Manage RBAC** with principle of least privilege
4. **Ensure Compliance** with SOC2, ISO27001, and regulatory requirements
5. **Automate Security Scanning** and vulnerability management
6. **Provide Security Monitoring** and incident response capabilities

## Decision

We chose a **comprehensive Policy as Code approach** using Kyverno for policy enforcement, combined with Pod Security Standards, Network Policies, RBAC, and automated security scanning tools.

## Rationale

### **Policy as Code Advantages**

#### 1. **Automated Policy Enforcement**
- **Admission controllers** for real-time policy validation
- **Mutation policies** for automatic security configuration
- **Validation policies** for compliance enforcement
- **Background scanning** for existing resource validation

#### 2. **Declarative Security Configuration**
- **Version-controlled policies** with Git workflow
- **Code review process** for security changes
- **Automated testing** of security policies
- **Rollback capabilities** for policy changes

#### 3. **Comprehensive Coverage**
- **Pod Security Standards** implementation
- **Network policy** automation
- **RBAC** management and validation
- **Compliance** framework integration

### **Technology Stack Selection**

#### 1. **Kyverno vs. OPA Gatekeeper**

| Aspect | Kyverno | OPA Gatekeeper |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| Configuration | YAML-based | Rego language |
| Learning Curve | Low | High |
| Kubernetes Native | Yes | Yes |
| Mutation Support | Excellent | Limited |
| Community | Growing | Mature |

**Decision**: Kyverno chosen for YAML-based configuration and excellent mutation support

#### 2. **Pod Security Standards Implementation**
```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: disallow-privileged-containers
spec:
  validationFailureAction: enforce
  rules:
  - name: disallow-privileged-containers
    match:
      any:
      - resources:
          kinds:
          - Pod
    validate:
      message: "Privileged containers are not allowed"
      pattern:
        spec:
          =(securityContext):
            =(privileged): "false"
          containers:
          - name: "*"
            =(securityContext):
              =(privileged): "false"
```

#### 3. **Network Security Strategy**
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: default-deny-all
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  - Egress
  # Default deny all traffic
```

### **Security Framework Components**

#### 1. **Pod Security Standards**

**Restricted Profile Implementation**:
- **No privileged containers**
- **Required security contexts** with non-root users
- **Read-only root filesystems**
- **Dropped capabilities** (ALL)
- **No host namespace access**
- **Resource limits** enforcement

**Policy Examples**:
```yaml
# Require security context
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: require-security-context
spec:
  validationFailureAction: enforce
  rules:
  - name: require-security-context
    validate:
      pattern:
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: "*"
            securityContext:
              runAsNonRoot: true
              runAsUser: ">= 1000"
              allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
              readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
              capabilities:
                drop:
                - ALL
```

#### 2. **Network Security Policies**

**Zero Trust Network Implementation**:
- **Default deny all** network policies
- **Explicit allow** rules for required communication
- **Namespace isolation** with label-based selection
- **Ingress/egress** traffic control

**Multi-tier Network Security**:
```yaml
# Application tier isolation
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: modern-data-stack-network-policy
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      part-of: modern-data-stack
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  - Egress
  ingress:
  - from:
    - namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          name: modern-data-stack
    - namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          name: monitoring
  egress:
  - to:
    - namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          name: modern-data-stack
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 5432  # PostgreSQL
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 6379  # Redis
```

#### 3. **RBAC Framework**

**Role-Based Access Control Design**:
- **Principle of least privilege**
- **Role-based user categories**
- **Service account management**
- **Regular access reviews**

**Role Definitions**:
```yaml
# Data Engineer Role
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: data-engineer
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["pods", "pods/log", "pods/exec"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
- apiGroups: ["batch"]
  resources: ["jobs", "cronjobs"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch", "create", "update", "patch"]

# Data Scientist Role (more restricted)
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: data-scientist
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["pods", "pods/log"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
- apiGroups: ["batch"]
  resources: ["jobs"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch", "create"]
```

#### 4. **Compliance Monitoring**

**Automated Compliance Scanning**:
```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
  name: compliance-scan
spec:
  schedule: "0 2 * * *"  # Daily at 2 AM
  jobTemplate:
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: compliance-scanner
            image: aquasec/kube-bench:latest
            command:
            - /bin/sh
            - -c
            - |
              # Run CIS Kubernetes benchmark
              kube-bench --json > /tmp/compliance-report.json
              
              # Check for critical findings
              CRITICAL_COUNT=$(cat /tmp/compliance-report.json | jq '.Controls[] | select(.state == "FAIL" and .severity == "CRITICAL") | length')
              
              if [ "$CRITICAL_COUNT" -gt "0" ]; then
                # Send alert for critical violations
                curl -X POST http://alertmanager:9093/api/v1/alerts
              fi
```

### **Security Scanning and Monitoring**

#### 1. **Container Image Scanning**
- **Trivy** for vulnerability scanning
- **Multi-layer scanning** (OS, dependencies, secrets)
- **CI/CD integration** with build pipeline
- **Policy enforcement** for high-severity vulnerabilities

**Trivy Integration**:
```yaml
- name: Run Trivy Security Scanner
  uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@master
  with:
    image-ref: ${{ env.DOCKER_REGISTRY }}/${{ env.IMAGE_NAME }}:${{ github.sha }}
    format: 'sarif'
    output: 'trivy-results.sarif'
    exit-code: '1'
    severity: 'CRITICAL,HIGH'
```

#### 2. **Runtime Security Monitoring**
- **Falco** for runtime threat detection
- **Custom rules** for data platform threats
- **Integration** with alerting systems
- **Incident response** automation

**Falco Rules Example**:
```yaml
- rule: Unauthorized Process in Container
  desc: Detect unauthorized processes in containers
  condition: >
    spawned_process and 
    container and 
    not proc.name in (allowed_processes)
  output: >
    Unauthorized process started 
    (user=%user.name command=%proc.cmdline 
     container=%container.name)
  priority: CRITICAL
```

#### 3. **Security Metrics and Alerting**
```yaml
groups:
- name: security-alerts
  rules:
  - alert: PodSecurityViolation
    expr: increase(kyverno_policy_violations_total[5m]) > 0
    labels:
      severity: warning
    annotations:
      summary: "Pod security policy violation detected"
      
  - alert: UnauthorizedApiAccess
    expr: increase(kubernetes_audit_failed_requests_total[5m]) > 10
    labels:
      severity: critical
    annotations:
      summary: "High number of unauthorized API access attempts"
```
